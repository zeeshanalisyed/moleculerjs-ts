## Build

Builds the app for production into the dist folder.
```sh
npm run build
```

Once you built the app, you can run microservices with;

```sh
npm run start
```

## Docker

If you want to run the app with Docker, we already included `docker-compose.yaml`, `docker-compose.env` files and scripts to start and stop Docker deployment.

To start;
```js
npm run dc:up
```

To stop;
```js
npm run dc:down
```

> We are using `NATS` for communication between microservices in Docker deployment.
